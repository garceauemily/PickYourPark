## Abstract

Parking at Clemson is notoriously difficult for students, even those with valid parking passes. Driving around and searching for a spot often leads commuters to be late for class, however, this problem could be mitigated by providing students with information on parking lot availability before they start driving to campus. This project designs and implements a small-scale parking lot utilization monitoring system that can be applied on a larger scale to work on Clemsonâ€™s campus. This system uses FSRs embedded inside speed bumps as the primary detection system for cars entering and exiting a given parking lot. When an FSR detects the weight of a vehicle, it triggers an RFID scanner to check whether the vehicle has a valid parking pass. The collected data is processed by a Raspberry Pi that wirelessly transmits the information to a central server hosted on a laptop. The server accepts incoming connections and stores the received data in a database table. This data is displayed on an online dashboard that updates the number of available parking spaces in a given parking lot in real time. This dashboard allows commuters to eliminate time wasted driving around looking for an available parking space.
